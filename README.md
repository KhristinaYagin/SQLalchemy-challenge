In this module we had an introduction to three new tools: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. Use these tools to build knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. This lesson will combine what we learned about SQL with our favorite programming language: Python. SQLite is a SQL dialect that shares much of its syntax with PostgreSQL, but it’s entirely serverless. The SQLAlchemy, a Python library that’s designed to work with SQL databases. Complete an activity in which we analyzed weather data by using SQLAlchemy. After another activity in which we created new DataFrames based on United States census data, we were thought about object-oriented programming (OOP).

We learned:

I. Connect to a SQL database by using SQLAlchemy.

II. Perform basic SQL queries by using engine.execute().

III. Create Python classes and objects.

IV. Perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on data in a SQL database by using the SQLAlchemy object-relational mapper (ORM).
